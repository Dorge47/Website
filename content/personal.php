        <p>Welcome to my website! I wanted a way to let people know where to find me without having to include a list of a million different usernames, so here's this instead!</p>
        <p>I may or may not have also just wanted an excuse to flex my web design knowledge</p>

        <p>I won't give out my phone number on a public website, but Telegram is the next best option. It's also my main form of communication online, so if you want to reach me, this is how.</p>

        <p>Can't give out invites since this is a server that my friends and I use, but I couldn't find a way to embed just my profile. <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/103495877632466944" target="_blank">Here's a link, though!</a></p>
