        <p>Welcome to my website. I'm not looking for work just yet, but when I am, this is where I keep my r&eacute;sum&eacute;, past projects, and other work-related things. If you'd like to contact me anyway, I can always be reached at my work email address: <a href="mailto:Christopher@tulaus.dev">Christopher@tulaus.dev</a></p>

        <h1>GitHub</h1>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/Dorge47" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is where I keep all of my programming projects. While they may not all be incredible feats of programming, I do take pride in the vast majority of them. If you are going to view my profile, please keep in mind that my commit messages to my own repositories are intended to be comedic as well as informative, and do not reflect the commit messages I push to work-related repositories.</p>

        <h1>LinkedIn</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-andrade47/" target="_blank">My LinkedIn profile</a> isn't always up-to-date, but does contain academic and employment information from my high school days onwards.</p>
